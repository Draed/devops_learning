# 2.test_case

*Created on:* 2025-12-22

## Description 

Adding test case using "pytest" in order to "automatically" validate code :
- Adding test case using pytest framework

## Prerequisites

- Have python 3 installed

## Other change from previous stage :

- Remove previous shell script used to test api and replace it with pytest test.
- Using uvicorn insteadf of fastapi to start the api as it don't fail on path resolution with pytest
- Adding tests folder that contains test : using different folder from the "app" folder to separate code from test. This is will be later usefull when deploying application (and not having test in the code).
- Adding useful pytest configuration files :
    - `conftest.py` : to later add more advanced test features (database mock, fixture, ...)
    - `pytest.ini` : pytest configuration files for ensuring only specific files are used as test case (best practices)

## Usage

- Deploy application using virtualenv :
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload
```

- Run test (in another terminal) :
```
python -m pytest tests/
```
