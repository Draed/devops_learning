## Description 

A simple devops project base on TODO list application in order to learn and improve skills about devops.
The main idea is to create a simple application (TODO list) and deploy it using devops best practice and increase scalability.

Below all the steps (also called "stages") that occured during the app creation :

| stage name | Stage description | difficulty | 
| ---------  | ----------------- | ---------- |
| [1.api](./1.api/1.api.md) | Create simple rest api | easy |
| [2.test_case](./2.test_case/2.test_case.md) | Adding test case framework (pytest) to run test | easy |
| [3.ci](./3.ci/3.ci.md) | Adding ci to automate testing, linting, packaging, ... | easy |
| [4.python_docstring](./4.python_docstring/4.python_docstring.md) | Adding docstring documentation and html pdoc pages | easy |
